// FIX Sometimes bubble doesn't hide when selections is discarded by clicking somewhere on
       the page.

// TODO Hide bubble after some time when no action is made.

// TODO Remove unnecessary comments, especially form css files.

// TODO Add better description for the extension in both manifest.json, and package.json.

// CONSIDER Adding an option where a window mode (incognito, or normal) can be set for all,
            or for specific site/source.

// CONSIDER Adding context menu item for page, where current page(website) can be open
            in popup window
